- Cons :
#### I think there is some bug
#### I only make a 20 x 20 map
#### In my opinion, in this project i cannot fully apply SOLID Principle
#### My code is unefficient
####
- Pros :
#### The driver and user randomization works well
#### The 3 Main Features works well
#### I added "Exit" Feature
#### When Started, the cli app will always randomize the driver when there is an action
#### The cli app works well even if used continously
#### Price can be modified easily
#### The cli app gives "Trip Completed" Feedback when the user success Order a Go-Ride
#### The cli app gives "You already there" Feedback when the start place and the destination is the same
